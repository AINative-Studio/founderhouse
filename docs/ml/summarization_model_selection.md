# Meeting Summarization Model Selection

## Executive Summary

This document analyzes model options for meeting transcript summarization, comparing extractive vs. abstractive approaches, local vs. cloud deployments, and cost-quality tradeoffs. Our recommendation is a **hybrid approach** using Claude 3.5 Sonnet for primary summarization with GPT-4o-mini as a cost-effective fallback.

## Requirements Analysis

### Functional Requirements
- Summarize 1-hour meeting transcripts (8,000-15,000 words)
- Extract key topics, decisions, and action items
- Maintain factual accuracy ≥90%
- Process within 2 minutes post-call
- Support multiple meeting types (investor, team, customer, board)

### Non-Functional Requirements
- Cost: <$0.50 per meeting
- Latency: <120 seconds for full processing
- Scalability: Handle 100+ concurrent meetings
- Reliability: 99.5% uptime
- Privacy: Support on-premises deployment option

## Recommended Architecture: Hybrid Multi-Model Pipeline

### Model Selection Strategy

```python
def select_model(meeting_metadata):
    """
    Intelligent model routing based on meeting characteristics
    """
    if meeting_metadata.type in ["board", "investor", "strategic"]:
        return "claude-3.5-sonnet"

    elif meeting_metadata.duration > 90 or meeting_metadata.participants > 10:
        return "claude-3.5-sonnet"  # Better context handling

    elif meeting_metadata.type in ["1on1", "standup", "internal"]:
        return "gpt-4o-mini"

    elif cost_budget_exceeded():
        return "deepseek-v2"

    else:
        return "gpt-4o-mini"  # Default
```

### Cascading Fallback Strategy

1. **Primary:** Claude 3.5 Sonnet (high-value meetings)
2. **Secondary:** GPT-4o-mini (standard meetings)
3. **Tertiary:** DeepSeek-V2 (budget overflow)
4. **Emergency:** Local Llama-3-70B (API outage)

### Quality Assurance Layer

```python
def validate_summary(summary, transcript):
    """
    Quality checks before accepting summary
    """
    checks = {
        "min_length": len(summary.content) > 100,
        "has_structure": all(k in summary for k in ["topics", "decisions", "actions"]),
        "no_hallucination": check_factual_grounding(summary, transcript),
        "action_items_valid": validate_action_items(summary.actions),
        "confidence_threshold": summary.confidence > 0.7
    }

    if not all(checks.values()):
        # Retry with higher-tier model
        return retry_with_fallback()

    return summary
```

## Benchmark Results: Head-to-Head Comparison

*Assumes $1500/mo infrastructure amortized over 6000 meetings

### Key Findings

1. **Claude 3.5 Sonnet** leads in all quality metrics
2. **GPT-4o-mini** offers best cost-quality balance for standard use
3. **DeepSeek-V2** viable for high-volume, cost-sensitive scenarios
4. **Local models** only economical at very high scale (>5K meetings/mo)

## Cost Optimization Strategy

### Intelligent Token Management

```python
def optimize_token_usage(transcript):
    """
    Reduce costs while maintaining quality
    """
    # Remove filler words and redundant content
    cleaned = remove_filler_words(transcript)

    # Compress redundant sections
    compressed = compress_repetitive_sections(cleaned)

    # Remove low-value content (cross-talk, technical issues)
    filtered = filter_low_value_content(compressed)

    # Expected savings: 20-30% token reduction
    return filtered
```

### Caching Strategy

```python
# Cache transcript embeddings to avoid re-processing
# Use semantic similarity to detect duplicate/similar meetings
# Expected savings: 10-15% on recurring meeting types
```

### Batch Processing

- **Real-time:** High-priority meetings only
- **Batch (hourly):** Standard team meetings
- **Batch (daily):** Archived/backfill meetings
- Expected savings: 15-20% via rate optimization

### Monthly Cost Projections

**Scenario: 100 meetings/month**
- 20 high-priority → Claude 3.5: $5.00
- 60 standard → GPT-4o-mini: $5.40
- 20 low-priority → DeepSeek-V2: $0.28
- **Total: $10.68/month** (~$0.11/meeting average)

**Scenario: 1,000 meetings/month**
- 200 high-priority → Claude 3.5: $50
- 600 standard → GPT-4o-mini: $54
- 200 budget → DeepSeek-V2: $2.80
- **Total: $106.80/month** (~$0.11/meeting average)

**Break-even for self-hosting: ~4,000-5,000 meetings/month**

    }
}
```

### A/B Testing Framework

- Test prompt variations weekly
- Compare model performance on same meetings
- Measure user feedback (thumbs up/down)
- Iterate based on data

### User Feedback Loop

```python
def collect_feedback(meeting_id, summary_id, user_feedback):
    """
    Log user edits and ratings to improve prompts
    """
    feedback = {
        "meeting_id": meeting_id,
        "model_used": get_model(summary_id),
        "user_rating": user_feedback.rating,
        "manual_edits": user_feedback.edits,
        "missing_items": user_feedback.missing,
        "hallucinations": user_feedback.incorrect
    }

    # Use for weekly prompt optimization
    store_feedback(feedback)
```
