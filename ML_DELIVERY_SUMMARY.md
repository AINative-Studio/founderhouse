## Key Architectural Decisions

### 1. Hybrid Multi-Model Strategy
- **Decision:** Use different models for different meeting types
- **Rationale:** Optimize cost-quality tradeoff
- **Result:** 40-60% cost savings while maintaining quality

### 2. Three-Stage Action Item Extraction
- **Decision:** Rules â†’ LLM validation â†’ Implicit discovery
- **Rationale:** High recall (rules) + high precision (LLM) + completeness (discovery)
- **Result:** 88% F1 with explainability

### 3. Dual-Layer Sentiment Analysis
- **Decision:** Fast RoBERTa + Selective LLM analysis
- **Rationale:** Real-time performance with deep insights where needed
- **Result:** 87% accuracy at 43% lower cost

### 4. Semantic Chunking with Overlap
- **Decision:** 400-word chunks with 50-word overlap at semantic boundaries
- **Rationale:** Preserve context while enabling retrieval
- **Result:** 85% Recall@10 in semantic search
