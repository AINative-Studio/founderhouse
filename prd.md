## **8. AI Architecture**

### **Pipeline**

1. **Ingestion Layer (MCP adapters)**
   Unified data ingestion from all tools via MCPs.
2. **Vectorization (ZeroDB MCP)**
   Every transcript, message, and document is embedded and indexed.
3. **Reasoning Engine (AgentFlow)**
   Agent reasoning chain (context retrieval ‚Üí intent ‚Üí action ‚Üí reflection).
4. **Action Execution (Task Agents)**
   Calls MCPs to perform actions: create tasks, send emails, update notes.
5. **Feedback & Memory Loop**
   Learns from founder corrections to refine tone, summary style, and routing accuracy.

---

## **9. Example User Stories (BDD)**

### **Story 1 ‚Äî Unified Brief via MCP**

**Given** all MCP servers are connected (Zoom, Loom, Granola, Monday)
**When** the founder says ‚ÄúHey Chief, brief me for today‚Äù
**Then** the AI-CoS returns a structured Morning Brief compiled from all MCPs:

* Meeting summaries (Zoom/Fireflies/Otter)
* Async Loom updates
* Slack/Discord summaries
* KPI snapshot from Granola

---

### **Story 2 ‚Äî Meeting Summary + Action Sync**

**Given** a meeting was recorded on Zoom
**When** Fireflies MCP delivers transcript
**Then** the agent summarizes and routes action items to Monday MCP and sends follow-up drafts via Outlook MCP.

---

### **Story 3 ‚Äî Loom Context Recall**

**Given** the founder recorded a Loom product demo two weeks ago
**When** asked ‚ÄúWhat did I say about investor onboarding last week?‚Äù
**Then** the AI-CoS retrieves that Loom transcript from ZeroDB MCP and summarizes key talking points.

---

### **Story 4 ‚Äî Voice Command Execution**

**Given** the founder says via ZeroVoice MCP:

> ‚ÄúRemind me to ping Alex after the board meeting.‚Äù
> **Then** the AI-CoS creates a Monday.com task and drafts the email using Outlook MCP.
